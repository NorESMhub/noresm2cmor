NORESM2CMOR
-----------

1. How does it work? 

noresm2cmor is a command line tool for post-processing NorESM output using 
the Climate Model Output Rewriter (cmor) libraries. 

Path and experiment information are set in a namelist file which the tool
reads during execution. For each experiment, it is recommended to create 
a new namelist file and place it in the folder noresm2cmor/namelist. 

2. Installation
 
Download and unpack:
  cd ~
  wget http://ns2345k.norstore.no/cmor/noresm2cmor_v20151109.tbz
  tar xvf noresm2cmor_v20151109.tbz

Build (modify Makefile before building): 
  cd  noresm2cmor/build
  make Makefile

Install sample output on local scratch (modify scratch path if neccessary):
  cd /scratch/$USER
  wget http://noresg.norstore.no/thredds/fileServer/esg_dataroot/ns2345k/outputsample.tar
  tar xf outputsample.tar

3. Testing 

cd ~/noresm2cmor/run 
../

NOTE: Before running the simple test-script, change ibasedir and obasedir in 
      all namelist files in ~/noresm2cmor/run_simple/test_simple
 
Advanced testing using wrapper scripts: 
  cd ~/noresm2cmor/run_wrapper
  ./test_wrapper.sh 

NOTE: Before running, change IBASEDIR and OBASEDIR in test_wrapper.sh

3. Processing a new experiment 

Processing a new experiment involves following steps: 1) creation of an
experiment namelist that contains necessary meta-information like experiment id,
parent experiment id, transient forcings, branch time and reference year. 2)
modification of some variable-namelists in case other than the default CMIP5
variables are to be written. 3) creation of a run script that processes the data
of the particular experiment. 

3.1. Experiment namelist 

Each experiment needs its own experiment namelist in the "noresm2cmor/namelist"
folder. 

The file name of the namelist must be "exp_.nml" (e.g. "exp_control.nml"). Valid
CMIP5 experiment names (long and short versions) are listed at the beginning of
each CMIP5 table, e.g. in "noresm2cmor/table/CMIP5_aero". 

Only a few of the namelist fields need to be customized. Therefore, the easiest
way is to copy a namelist from an existing experiment and then modify it. The
namelist fields that need to be customized will are discussed here: 

The namelist field "experiment_id" must be set to either the long or the short
version of the CMIP5 experiment name (e.g. " experiment_id = 'piControl', "). 

The namelist field "parent_experiment_id" must be set to the CMIP5 experiment
name of the parent experiment exists then 'N/A' must be assigned. 

The namelist field "parent_experiment_rip" should be set to 'r1i1p1' if a parent
experiment exists and to 'N/A' if no parent experiment exists. 

The namelist field "forcings" consists of a comma seperated list of all
transient forcings (e.g. " forcings='GHG, SA, Oz, Sl, BC, OC', "). The forcing
acronyms are found at
http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/docs/cmip5_data_reference_syntax.pdf (appendix
1.2).  

The namelist field "branch_time" should be identical to the time value in the
atmospheric restart file that is used to initialize the experiment (e.g. "
branch_time=255135, " is used when branching from year 700 of a spinup/control
experiment). Use ncdump to obtain the time value of the restart file, e.g.
"ncdump -v time NAER1850CNOC_f19_g16_05.cam2.r.0700-01-01-00000.nc". The value
for branch_time must be set to 0 in case "parent_experiment=N/A". 

The namelist field "expstartyear" must be set to the reference year used in the
atmospheric output of the current experiment (e.g. " expstartyear=700, "). Use
ncdump to obtain the reference date, e.g. "ncdump -h
NRCP45AERCN_f19_g16_01.cam2.h0.2006-01.nc | grep time:units". 

3.2. Adding new variables 

For each model compont exists one namelist in the namelist folder that specifies
the variables to be processed, namely: var_cam2cmor.nml, var_cice2cmor.nml,
var_clm2cmor.nml and var_micom2cmor.nml. 

Each variable namelist is devided into several sections which correspond to the
data collections defined in the tables in "noresm2cmor/table". The tables define
all possible/valid variables that can be delivered to the project. 

Each variable that should be processed is presented by one line in the variable
namelist. The first argument specifies the variable name as written in the model
output (alternatively, a linear combination of several variables can be
specified). The second argument specifies the variable name as declared in the
corresponding table. The third argument specifies special actions that should be
applied before writing the data. Further information on the syntax etc is found
in the namelists.   

3.3 Run script 

An example for a run script is stored in "noresm2cmor/run_wrapper/test_wrapper.sh". 

The run script calls the wrappers for the corresponding model components. The
syntax of the wrapper call is:  
"cam2cmor.sh <noresm case name> <cmip5 exp. id> <first year> <last year>
<output group> <output variable> <in dir> <out dir> "
If all years are to be processed then one can optionally set <first year> and
<last year> to 0 and 9999, respectively. If all variables are to be processed
then both <output group> and <output variable> should be set to "All".
