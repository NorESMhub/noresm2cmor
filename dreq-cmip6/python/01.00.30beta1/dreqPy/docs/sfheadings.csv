Column A	Variable shape: each row aggregates a number of variables which all have the the same dimensions.
Column B	Number of floating point values per time value. For smaller fields this may be a rough approximation. For larger fields it is based on the nominal model resolution
Column C	Number of bytes per float: a value of two assumes 4 bytes in precision and 50% compression
Column D	Total volume for this shape, summing all frequencies
Column E	Number of variables with this shape and frequency
Column F	Average number of years per variable (all experiments)
Column G	Number of experiments for which this shape/frequency is requested
Column H	Volume associated with this group of variables (Gb)
